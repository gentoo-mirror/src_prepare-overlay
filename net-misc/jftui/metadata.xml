        jftui is a minimalistic, lightweight C99 command line client for the open source Jellyfin media server.
        It is developed for the GNU/Linux OS only, although it may be possible to make it run on BSD's.
        Run jftui. You will be prompted for a minimal interactive configuration on first run.
        BEWARE: jftui fetches https://github.com/Aanok/jftui/releases/latest on startup to check for newer versions. You can avoid this by passing the --no-check-updates argument. There is also a settings file entry.
        The interface should be intuitive enough: select one or more entries by entering the corresponding index number. See below for a full description of the command syntax.
        jftui will drop into a command line instance of mpv when starting playback. It will use mpv.conf and input.conf files found in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jftui (this location can be overridden with the --config-dir argument). It will also try and load scripts found in the same folder, but no guarantees are made about them actually working correctly.
        It is recommended to consult the wiki page on configuring mpv commands to use jftui: a few special ones are required in particular to manipulate the playback playlist.
