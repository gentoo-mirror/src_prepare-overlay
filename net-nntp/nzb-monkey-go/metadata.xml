    nzb-monkey-go is a Golang rewrite of the NZB Monkey, the reference
    implementation of how to handle a NZBLNK-URI. nzb-monkey-go also includes
    the NZBSearcher functionality, so besides the nzb search engines it can
    also search directly on the news server and create the NZB file from the
    article headers.
