        systemd-cgls recursively shows the contents of the selected Linux
        control group hierarchy in a tree. If arguments are specified,
        shows all member processes of the specified control groups plus
        all their subgroups and their members. The control groups may either
        be specified by their full file paths or are assumed in the systemd
        control group hierarchy. If no argument is specified and the current
        working directory is beneath the control group mount point
        /sys/fs/cgroup/, shows the contents of the control group the working
        directory refers to. Otherwise, the full systemd control group
        hierarchy is shown.
