  <longdescription>
    This is the original upstream xpad driver from the Linux kernel with support
    for Xbox One controllers removed. If you are running the xone driver you
    will have to replace the xpad kernel module with this one to retain the
    functionality of Xbox and Xbox 360 controllers.
