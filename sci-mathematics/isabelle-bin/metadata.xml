    Isabelle is a generic proof assistant. It allows mathematical formulas
    to be expressed in a formal language and provides tools for proving
    those formulas in a logical calculus. Isabelle was originally developed
    at the University of Cambridge and Technische Universität München,
    but now includes numerous contributions from institutions
    and individuals worldwide.
    See the Isabelle overview for a brief introduction.
