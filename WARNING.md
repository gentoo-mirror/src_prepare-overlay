# WARNING!

Before you continue, **read [TODO.md](../TODO.md)!**


## Known bugs

You can still file issues to let us and others know when something breaks.

- kernel packages may install a different version, check the version you got after installation
- Icecat is broken, like 80% of the time, we know...


## Outdated packages

That's why we have [euscan-ng](https://gitlab.com/src_prepare/euscan-ng). If a package is not updated then it's possible that the new package is broken.


## Merge issues

Don't file bugs for those packages here, ask upstream for a fix:

- Palemoon is a resource hog during build
