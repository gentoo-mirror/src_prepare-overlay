        fchroot, also known as "Franken-Chroot" or "Funtoo Chroot", is a utility that helps you to leverage the magic of QEMU to chroot into a non-native system.
        For example, on your x86-compatible 64-bit PC, it is possible to chroot into a 32-bit or 64-bit ARM environment and have it actually work.
        This is accomplished by leveraging the "binfmt-misc" functionality built-in to the Linux kernel, combined with QEMU to perform emulation of non-native instruction sets.
        fchroot itself doesn't do any magic except provide a very easy-to-use mechanism to get this to work, typically requiring little or no manual configuration.
        You simply run fchroot just like chroot, and everything works.
