## How to contribute

src_prepare-overlay is very open to contribution and encourages it.
There are several ways to contribute for this overlay:

#### Filing an issue

Those that do not have good knowledge in writing ebuilds can
[file an issue](https://gitlab.com/src_prepare/src_prepare-overlay/-/issues)
so we can create the ebuild and maintain it for the community.
Before filing an issue, you will have to read the [contributing guidelines](#filing-an-issue-1).

#### Pulling Merge Requests

Those that want to help us easily maintain an ebuild without making us spend our time creating on it
can create the ebuild and pull a [merge request](https://gitlab.com/src_prepare/src_prepare-overlay/-/merge_requests)
so we can add the ebuild into our overlay and maintain it for you.
Before pulling merge requests, you will have to read the [contributing guidelines](#pulling-merge-requests-1).
